              <p>Chinese-born Lan Yu is one of Asia's most influential designers, earning widespread recognition from celebrities and the media in her home country. This season, she prepares to make an entrance onto the American stage, debuting her collection at New York Fashion Week for the very first time.

"The Chinese market is growing very fast in terms of purchasing power, sales, and number of consumers, but it's lacking leadership," Yu told NBC News. "The U.S. market is still the 'trend setter' to which people are looking to for the next big idea. That's actually part of the reason why we are here â€” I think the best way for the Chinese fashion industry to catch up with its huge consumer demand is to launch international brands."</p>
