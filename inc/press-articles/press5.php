              <p>You can't cover fashion week without calling out the best front row appearances. And with the New York shows in full swing, there are plenty of front row moments that make us giddy with excitement. From the A-list lineup at the Yeezy Season 4 show to BFFs Taylor Swift and Martha Hunt cheering on Gigi Hadid as she debuted her collection with Tommy Hilfiger, front row seating never disappoints. The latest VIP moment during NYFW? When former The City co-stars Whitney Port and Olivia Palermo posed for a quick photo right before taking their (front row) seats. 
The duo attended the debut show for Chinese designer Lanyu last night and both reality starsâ€“turned-fashion designers looked insanely stylish, of course. </p>
