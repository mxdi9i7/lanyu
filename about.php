        Lan Yu's designs balance Chinese embroidery techniques with Western structural designs. Her designs exhibit a knowledge of Su Xiu, a form of traditional Chinese embroidery handed down through three generations of her family, as well as formal studies in Western couture design to produce a style that integrates elements from both cultures. Her pieces are regularly featured on celebrity clients at Cannes, Venice, Tokyo and Berlin Film Festival, as well as China’s film festivals and other red carpet events.
