Lan's designs balance Chinese embroidery techniques with Western structural designs. Her designs exhibit a knowledge of Su Xiu, a form of traditional Chinese embroidery handed down through three generations of her family, as well as formal studies in Western couture design to produce a style that integrates elements from both cultures. Her pieces are regularly featured on celebrity clients at Cannes, Venice, Tokyo and Berlin Film Festival, as well as Chinaâ€™s film festivals and other red carpet events.</p>
